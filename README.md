# About Me

<p>
  Hey, I’m Landen, a dedicated Software Developer and Computer Science student looking for more opportunities to drive my passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. I currently hold an Associate of Science in Computer Science and am pursuing my Bachelor of Science.

My expertise lies in both front-end and back-end development, specializing in:

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C#, Dart
Frameworks & Libraries: React, Flutter, .NET
Databases: MySQL, SQL Server
I thrive on challenges and enjoy expanding my skill set, currently diving deeper into C# and .NET technologies. My goal is to contribute to projects that enhance user experiences and drive successful outcomes.

When I'm not coding, I love exploring new technologies, participating in coding communities, and continuously learning to stay updated with industry trends. I’m actively looking for software developer opportunities where I can apply my skills and grow as a professional.

Feel free to check out my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out for collaboration or networking!
